NAME
    Comodo::DCV - DCV logic for COMODO SSL APIs

SYNOPSIS
      use Comodo::DCV;

      #The following acts on a DER-formatted (i.e., binary) CSR only.
      my ($filename, $contents) = Comodo::DCV::get_filename_and_contents( $csr_der );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements logic that is necessary for HTTP-based validation
    according to COMODO’s APIs for SSL certificate issuance, as documented
    at
    <http://secure.comodo.net/api/pdf/latest/Domain%20Control%20Validation.p
    df>.

    You can verify this module’s output by comparing it to that from
    <https://secure.comodo.net/utilities/decodeCSR.html>.

    NOTE: This module works on DER-formatted (binary) CSRs. If you need to
    work with PEM-formatted (text/Base64) CSRs, first convert them via
    "Crypt::Format" or similar logic.
